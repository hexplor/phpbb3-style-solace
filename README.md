* **Template Inheritance** - unlike other phpBB styles, Solace is based on core template inheritance. This major feature dramatically increases extensions compatibility and makes easy to update Solace in the feature. For example, other styles includes around 150 (!) files inside their templates folder. This makes phpBB updating very difficult and long process. We included only 3 files. Rest is automatically inherited from prosilver. When you update your phpBB to newer version, Solace will be updated as well. Only minor changes might be needed.
* **Prosilver CSS ordering** - instead of complicating things with additional scss, less setups, we included css files the way it's done in prosilver (default phpBB style). No scss, less recompiling needed. Style modification is easy as pie :)
* **Multi Language** - Solace supports all languages (around 50) provided by [phpbb.com](https://www.phpbb.com/languages/)
* **FontAwesome and ET Line-Style Icons included** - two font icon libraries included with Solace gives you opportunity to assign around 700 icons to various forum parts.
* **Documentation** - style download contains detailed documentation for beginners and for advanced users.
